# 2. Use the FastAPI web framework

Date: 28-02-2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to implement an API to expose the functionality of our application. We need to decide which technology to use.

## Decision

After evaluating both Flask and FastAPI, we have decided to use FastAPI for the following reasons:

- Easy to learn and use
- Automatically generates API documentation
- Good performance
- Data validation
- Supports asynchronous code
- We have other projects using it

Compared to Flask, FastAPI fits better our API requirements.

## Consequences

We will need to spend time learning the FastAPI framework.
